This is a project that generates a json file showing all countries linked to their states or provinces and cities. The json file is generated when you run `node generate.js`. The feeder files i.e city.json, state.json and country.json where obtained from `https://github.com/khkwan0/countryCityStateJson/tree/master/src/country-state-city/lib`.
